# Kirbapi (React)

This is a refactored version of an attempt to create a Kirby API that contained all information about the Kirby franchise from games to enemies and more. Due to the scale of making an API and doing is solo I made the decision to make this small overview off all Kirby copy abilities.

The site extracts all information from the json file inside the project so if you want the data you can get it from there or you can go to the official wikis ability page: https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:_Abilities to view the extensive list of abilities and the complete information.

Site is hosted and reachable from: https://kirbapi.web.app/
